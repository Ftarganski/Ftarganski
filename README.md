## Hey Folks! ðŸ‘‹                                

On the way to completing my Postgraduate Degree as a Full Stack Web Developer, with a degree in Architecture and Urbanism, I have more than ten years of experience in multinational companies, with a strong knowledge of corporate culture.

In my professional career, I worked both in project management positions and in people management positions, having achieved relevant results for the companies I worked for.

My technical training and professional experience qualify me to understand the nuances and responsibilities that the position now offered requires. Added to this is my personal experience as a father, traveler and entrepreneur, moments in life in which I acquired knowledge that is not taught in the chair, knowledge of rare value.

The main differentiator at any company is itâ€™s employees. Most importantly it takes team players who can thrive, function and excel in a global market. I have these qualities.

I am looking for new job opportunities where I can more dynamically explore the knowledge acquired in recent years. I am always ready for new challenges, working with flexibility and enthusiasm.

```
If you are ready to work with a talented team player, please contact me ðŸ’¬.
